# VMware Validated Design 5.1.1

With each release of the VMware Validated Designs, the Solutions Architecture team creates or updates the Design Decisions provided in the Architecture and Design sections of the documentation. 

It's our pleasure to share the Design Decisions from VMware Validated Design 5.1.1 release in Microsoft Excel format with the community. 

If you have deployed or plan to deploy the VMware Validated Design, you can use these Design Decisions to ensure compliance with the design.

The set includes:

* Standard Architecture
    * Management Domain (Dual-Region and Multi-AZ).
    * Workload Domain - Virtual Infrastructure (Dual-Region and Multi-AZ).
    * Cloud Operations and Automation (Dual-Region and Multi-AZ).
