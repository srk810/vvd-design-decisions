With each release of the VMware Validated Designs, the Solutions Architecture team creates or updates the Design Decisions provided in the Architecture and Design sections of the documentation. 

It's our pleasure to share the Design Decisions from VMware Validated Design 6.2.0 release in Microsoft Excel format with the community.

* Standard Architecture
    * Management Domain (Single-Region and Multi-AZ).
    * Workload Domain - Virtual Infrastructure (Single-Region and Multi-AZ).
    * Tanzu Workload Domain (Single-Region)
